# Open Trial Exchange

Open Trial Exchange is an open source project for securely exchanging confidential information and intellectual property in the clinical trial process. It leverages the security and encryption capabilities of OpenSSL, GnuPG, Keybase, and IPFS to provide a secure and compliant environment for exchanging sensitive information.

## Key Features
- End-to-end encryption using OpenSSL and GnuPG
- Secure key management using Keybase
- Distributed file storage using IPFS, allowing data and intellectual property providers to seed their data on the network
- Authorized access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access the encrypted data
- Compliance with industry standards and regulations

## Getting Started
To get started with Open Trial Exchange, you will need to install the following components:

- OpenSSL
- GnuPG
- Keybase
- IPFS
Once you have installed the required components, you can configure Open Trial Exchange to meet your specific security and compliance requirements. Data and intellectual property providers can then seed their data on IPFS, encrypting it and making it only accessible by authorized users.
